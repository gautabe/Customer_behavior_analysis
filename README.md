📊 End-to-End Data Analytics Project
🔎 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow, transforming raw data into actionable business insights and interactive visualizations.

The main objectives were to:

Load and explore a dataset using Python

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Execute analytical SQL queries across multiple database systems

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard

Produce a structured analytical report

Create a professional presentation using Gamma

This project highlights practical skills in data analysis, SQL, data visualization, dashboard development, and business reporting.

📁 Dataset

The dataset consists of structured business data containing information such as customers, transactions, revenue, and product categories.

Data Characteristics

Numerical features (e.g., sales, revenue, quantity)

Categorical features (e.g., gender, category, region)

Date/time fields

Missing values requiring cleaning and preprocessing

Business Questions Addressed

What are the overall revenue trends?

Which customer segments generate the highest revenue?

Which product categories perform best?

Are there significant differences across demographic groups?

Are there seasonal patterns in sales?

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

PostgreSQL

MySQL

SQL Server

Power BI

Gamma (Presentation design)

Jupyter Notebook

Git & GitHub

⚙️ Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Loading (Python)

Imported the dataset using Pandas

Inspected structure, data types, and summary statistics

Identified missing values and inconsistencies

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions of key variables

Explored correlations and trends

Visualized insights using charts

Detected outliers and anomalies

3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values (mean/median imputation strategies)

Removed duplicates

Standardized column names and formats

Converted appropriate data types

Ensured data integrity before database integration

4️⃣ SQL Analysis (Multi-Database)

The cleaned dataset was loaded into:

PostgreSQL

MySQL

SQL Server

Key SQL tasks included:

Revenue calculation by category and segment

Customer behavior analysis

Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

Use of GROUP BY, JOIN, subqueries

Comparison of syntax and performance across systems

This demonstrates cross-database adaptability and strong SQL fundamentals.

5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard Development

Connected Power BI to the SQL database

Built interactive visualizations:

Revenue trends over time

Customer segmentation

Category performance comparison

Implemented slicers and filters

Designed a clean, executive-level dashboard layout

6️⃣ Reporting

Produced a structured analytical report including:

Business objectives

Methodology

Key findings

Strategic recommendations

7️⃣ Presentation (Gamma)

Designed a professional slide deck highlighting:

Problem statement

Analytical approach

Key insights

Dashboard visuals

Business impact

📊 Dashboard Overview

The Power BI dashboard includes:

📈 Revenue trends analysis

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Customer segmentation insights

📊 Category performance breakdown

🔍 Interactive filtering for deeper exploration

The dashboard is designed to support data-driven decision-making by quickly identifying performance gaps and growth opportunities.

📈 Key Results & Insights

A small number of product categories contribute to the majority of total revenue (Pareto principle).

Certain customer segments generate significantly higher sales.

Seasonal patterns influence purchasing behavior.

Proper data cleaning significantly improved analytical accuracy and reliability.

This project demonstrates the ability to convert raw data into meaningful business insights.
