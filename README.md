📊 Data Analytics Project
1. Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from raw data processing to business insights visualization.

The objective was to:

Load and explore a dataset using Python

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Execute SQL queries across different database systems

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard

Generate a professional analytical report

Create a presentation using Gamma

This project highlights practical skills in data analysis, SQL, data visualization, and business reporting.

2. Dataset

The dataset contains structured business data (e.g., customers, transactions, revenue, or product-related information).

It includes:

Numerical features (e.g., sales, revenue, quantity)

Categorical features (e.g., gender, category, region)

Date/time information

Missing values requiring cleaning

The dataset was used to answer key business questions such as:

What are the revenue trends?

Which categories or segments perform best?

Are there differences across customer groups?

3. Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Power BI

Gamma (for presentation design)

Jupyter Notebook

Git & GitHub

4. Project Steps
Step 1: Data Loading (Python)

Imported dataset using Pandas

Inspected structure, data types, and summary statistics

Identified missing values and inconsistencies

Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions of key variables

Identified trends and correlations

Visualized patterns using charts

Detected outliers and anomalies

Step 3: Data Cleaning

Handled missing values (median/mean/imputation strategies)

Removed duplicates

Standardized column formats

Converted data types where necessary

Step 4: SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into:

PostgreSQL

MySQL

SQL Server

Wrote queries to:

Calculate revenue by category

Analyze customer behavior

Compute aggregates (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

Use GROUP BY, JOIN, subqueries

Compared query performance and syntax differences across systems

Step 5: Power BI Dashboard

Connected Power BI to the SQL database

Built interactive visualizations:

Revenue trends

Customer segmentation

Performance by category

Implemented slicers and filters

Designed a clean, business-oriented dashboard layout

Step 6: Reporting

Created a structured analytical report including:

Business objectives

Methodology

Key insights

Recommendations

Step 7: Presentation (Gamma)

Designed a professional slide deck

Highlighted:

Problem statement

Key findings

Visual dashboard screenshots

Business impact

5. Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:

📈 Revenue trends over time

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Customer segmentation insights

📊 Category performance comparison

🔍 Interactive filtering for deeper analysis

The dashboard enables decision-makers to quickly identify growth opportunities and performance gaps.

6. Key Results & Insights

Some of the main findings include:

Certain customer segments generate significantly higher revenue.

A small number of categories contribute to the majority of total sales (Pareto effect).

Seasonal patterns influence revenue trends.

Data cleaning significantly improved analytical accuracy.

This project demonstrates the ability to transform raw data into actionable business insights.
